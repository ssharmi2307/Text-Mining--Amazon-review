    Great product! You need to check the dimensions of the washing machine with the place where you want to keep it before you order it. Use  front load liquid detergents only and better to use Bosch washing cover as well.Why all this? Because it is a costly product so keep it with care. Mixed load option is the one which is going to be used 90% time.

    Great product! You need to check the dimensions of the washing machine with the place where you want to keep it before you order it. Use  front load liquid detergents only and better to use Bosch washing cover as well.Why all this? Because it is a costly product so keep it with care. Mixed load option is the one which is going to be used 90% time.

    Great product! You need to check the dimensions of the washing machine with the place where you want to keep it before you order it. Use  front load liquid detergents only and better to use Bosch washing cover as well.Why all this? Because it is a costly product so keep it with care. Mixed load option is the one which is going to be used 90% time.

    Great product! You need to check the dimensions of the washing machine with the place where you want to keep it before you order it. Use  front load liquid detergents only and better to use Bosch washing cover as well.Why all this? Because it is a costly product so keep it with care. Mixed load option is the one which is going to be used 90% time.

    Great product! You need to check the dimensions of the washing machine with the place where you want to keep it before you order it. Use  front load liquid detergents only and better to use Bosch washing cover as well.Why all this? Because it is a costly product so keep it with care. Mixed load option is the one which is going to be used 90% time.

    Great product! You need to check the dimensions of the washing machine with the place where you want to keep it before you order it. Use  front load liquid detergents only and better to use Bosch washing cover as well.Why all this? Because it is a costly product so keep it with care. Mixed load option is the one which is going to be used 90% time.

    Great product! You need to check the dimensions of the washing machine with the place where you want to keep it before you order it. Use  front load liquid detergents only and better to use Bosch washing cover as well.Why all this? Because it is a costly product so keep it with care. Mixed load option is the one which is going to be used 90% time.

    Power cord length is very short. If you are having electrical point on 5 feet height then you have to move it down to 3 feet height.

    Great product! You need to check the dimensions of the washing machine with the place where you want to keep it before you order it. Use  front load liquid detergents only and better to use Bosch washing cover as well.Why all this? Because it is a costly product so keep it with care. Mixed load option is the one which is going to be used 90% time.

    It’s been a month since I bought it. Works good. Easy to use. It does make mild noise. Dries clothes upto 70%. Installation was on time. Worth it.
